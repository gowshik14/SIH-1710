## Problem Title
SIH 1710: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations
## Problem Description
Background: Railway stations are complex environments with numerous facilities and locations such as ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, food courts, and waiting areas. Passengers often face difficulties in navigating these spaces, especially in large or unfamiliar stations. Efficient and user-friendly navigation systems are crucial for improving passenger experience, reducing congestion, and ensuring timely travel connections. Description: The problem involves developing a comprehensive navigation solution for railway stations that assists passengers in locating various facilities and destinations within the station premises. This includes creating detailed maps, providing real-time directions, and integrating features such as accessibility options for individuals with disabilities. The solution should be intuitive, easy to use, and accessible via multiple platforms, including mobile devices and digital kiosks. Key challenges include updating navigation information in real-time, ensuring accuracy, and accommodating the diverse needs of all passengers. Expected Solution: The expected solution is a multi-platform navigation system that provides detailed, real-time directions to all facilities and locations within a railway station. This system should include: A mobile application with 3D interactive maps and step-by-step navigation. Digital kiosks located throughout the station with touch-screen interfaces. Voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers. Regular updates to reflect changes in station layout and facility locations. Integration with existing railway apps and services for seamless user experience. The solution should enhance the overall passenger experience by reducing confusion, saving time, and improving accessibility within the station.

## Idea
Develop a smart web platform that helps users locate the nearest authorized e-waste recycling facilities, educates them about the environmental and health hazards of improper disposal, and rewards responsible recycling through a credit-based incentive system.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
1. Nearest E-Waste Facility Locator

Uses geolocation and mapping services to detect the user’s location.

Displays nearby authorized e-waste collection and recycling centers on an interactive map.

Supports image recognition to identify the type of e-waste when users upload device photos and recommends the correct facility.

2. AI-Powered Virtual Assistant

Guides users on:

Safe e-waste disposal methods

Data wiping and privacy protection for old devices

Answers common questions related to recycling policies and procedures.

3. Educational Awareness Pop-ups

Displays contextual pop-ups explaining:

Harmful components in e-waste (lead, mercury, cadmium, etc.)

Environmental and health impacts of improper disposal

Encourages responsible behavior through short, easy-to-understand insights.

4. Reward Points System

Users can input the model and type of device they plan to recycle.

The system estimates recoverable precious metals and awards credit points accordingly.

Points can be redeemed for certificates, discounts, or eco-rewards, motivating participation.

5. Real-Time Analytics Dashboard

Provides recycling facilities and administrators with:

Real-time recycling statistics

Energy and resource savings

Environmental impact insights

Helps track progress toward sustainability goals.

## Use Cases

1.Citizens searching for nearby e-waste recycling centers

2.Users learning safe disposal and data protection practices

3.Government agencies monitoring recycling trends

4.Recycling facilities analyzing operational performance
